.SH "NAME"
cargo\-clippy \- Check the current package with clippy
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\f[CR]cargo clippy [\fIOPTIONS\fP]\fP
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Check a local package and all of its local dependencies for common mistakes
with clippy. This will essentially compile the packages without performing the
final step of code generation, which is faster than running \f[CR]cargo build\fP. The
compiler will save metadata files to disk so that future runs will reuse them
if the source has not been modified.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.SS "Package Selection"
.sp
By default, when no package selection options are given, the packages selected
depend on the selected manifest file (based on the current working directory if
\f[CR]\-\-manifest\-path\fP is not given). If the manifest is the root of a workspace then
the workspaces default members are selected, otherwise only the package defined
by the manifest will be selected.
.sp
The default members of a workspace can be set explicitly with the
\f[CR]workspace.default\-members\fP key in the root manifest. If this is not set, a
virtual workspace will include all workspace members (equivalent to passing
\f[CR]\-\-workspace\fP), and a non\-virtual workspace will include only the root crate itself.
.sp
\fB\-p\fP \fISPEC\fP..., \fB\-\-package\fP \fISPEC\fP...
.RS 4
Clippy only the specified packages. See \fBcargo\-pkgid\fP(1) for the
SPEC format. This flag may be specified multiple times.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-workspace\fP
.RS 4
Clippy all members in the workspace.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-all\fP
.RS 4
Deprecated alias for \f[CR]\-\-workspace\fP.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-exclude\fP \fISPEC\fP...
.RS 4
Exclude the specified packages. Must be used in conjunction with the
\f[CR]\-\-workspace\fP flag. This flag may be specified multiple times.
.RE
.SS "Target Selection"
.sp
When no target selection options are given, \f[CR]cargo clippy\fP will check all
binary and library targets of the selected packages. Binaries are skipped if
they have \f[CR]required\-features\fP that are missing.
.sp
Passing target selection flags will clippy only the
specified targets.
.sp
\fB\-\-lib\fP
.RS 4
Clippy the package\(cqs library.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-bin\fP \fINAME\fP...
.RS 4
Clippy the specified binary. This flag may be specified multiple times.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-bins\fP
.RS 4
Clippy all binary targets.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-example\fP \fINAME\fP...
.RS 4
Clippy the specified example. This flag may be specified multiple times.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-examples\fP
.RS 4
Clippy all example targets.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-test\fP \fINAME\fP...
.RS 4
Clippy the specified integration test. This flag may be specified multiple
times.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-tests\fP
.RS 4
Clippy all targets in test mode that have the \f[CR]test = true\fP manifest
flag set. By default this includes the library and binaries built as
unittests, and integration tests. Be aware that this will also build any
required dependencies, so the lib target may be built twice (once as a
unittest, and once as a dependency for binaries, integration tests, etc.).
Targets may be enabled or disabled by setting the \f[CR]test\fP flag in the
manifest settings for the target.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-bench\fP \fINAME\fP...
.RS 4
Clippy the specified benchmark. This flag may be specified multiple times.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-benches\fP
.RS 4
Clippy all targets in benchmark mode that have the \f[CR]bench = true\fP
manifest flag set. By default this includes the library and binaries built
as benchmarks, and bench targets. Be aware that this will also build any
required dependencies, so the lib target may be built twice (once as a
benchmark, and once as a dependency for binaries, benchmarks, etc.).
Targets may be enabled or disabled by setting the \f[CR]bench\fP flag in the
manifest settings for the target.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-all\-targets\fP
.RS 4
Clippy all targets. This is equivalent to specifying \f[CR]\-\-lib \-\-bins
\-\-tests \-\-benches \-\-examples\fP.
.RE
.SS "Feature Selection"
.sp
When no feature options are given, the \f[CR]default\fP feature is activated for
every selected package.
.sp
\fB\-\-features\fP \fIFEATURES\fP
.RS 4
Space or comma separated list of features to activate. These features only
apply to the current directory\(cqs package. Features of direct dependencies
may be enabled with \f[CR]<dep\-name>/<feature\-name>\fP syntax.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-all\-features\fP
.RS 4
Activate all available features of all selected packages.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-no\-default\-features\fP
.RS 4
Do not activate the \f[CR]default\fP feature of the current directory\(cqs
package.
.RE
.SS "Compilation Options"
.sp
\fB\-\-target\fP \fITRIPLE\fP
.RS 4
Clippy for the given architecture. The default is the host
architecture. The general format of the triple is
\f[CR]<arch><sub>\-<vendor>\-<sys>\-<abi>\fP. Run \f[CR]rustc \-\-print target\-list\fP for a
list of supported targets.
.sp
This may also be specified with the \f[CR]build.target\fP
.URL "https://doc.rust\-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html" "config value" "."
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-release\fP
.RS 4
Clippy optimized artifacts with the \f[CR]release\fP profile. See the
PROFILES section for details on how this affects profile selection.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-profile\fP \fINAME\fP
.RS 4
Changes clippy behavior. Currently only \f[CR]test\fP is
supported, which will clippy with the
\f[CR]#[cfg(test)]\fP attribute enabled. This is useful to have it
clippy unit tests which are usually excluded via
the \f[CR]cfg\fP attribute. This does not change the actual profile used.
.RE
.SS "Output Options"
.sp
\fB\-\-target\-dir\fP \fIDIRECTORY\fP
.RS 4
Directory for all generated artifacts and intermediate files. May also be
specified with the \f[CR]CARGO_TARGET_DIR\fP environment variable, or the
\f[CR]build.target\-dir\fP \c
.URL "https://doc.rust\-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html" "config value" "."
Defaults
to \f[CR]target\fP in the root of the workspace.
.RE
.SS "Display Options"
.sp
\fB\-v\fP, \fB\-\-verbose\fP
.RS 4
Use verbose output. May be specified twice for "very verbose" output which
includes extra output such as dependency warnings and build script output.
May also be specified with the \f[CR]term.verbose\fP
.URL "https://doc.rust\-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html" "config value" "."
.RE
.sp
\fB\-q\fP, \fB\-\-quiet\fP

\f[CR]json\-render\-diagnostics\fP: Instruct Cargo to not include rustc diagnostics in
in JSON messages printed, but instead Cargo itself should render the
JSON diagnostics coming from rustc. Cargo\(cqs own JSON diagnostics and others
coming from rustc are still emitted.
.RE
.RE
.SS "Manifest Options"
.sp
\fB\-\-manifest\-path\fP \fIPATH\fP
.RS 4
Path to the \f[CR]Cargo.toml\fP file. By default, Cargo searches in the current
directory or any parent directory for the \f[CR]Cargo.toml\fP file.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-frozen\fP, \fB\-\-locked\fP
.RS 4
Either of these flags requires that the \f[CR]Cargo.lock\fP file is
up\-to\-date. If the lock file is missing, or it needs to be updated, Cargo will
exit with an error. The \f[CR]\-\-frozen\fP flag also prevents Cargo from
attempting to access the network to determine if it is out\-of\-date.
.sp
These may be used in environments where you want to assert that the
\f[CR]Cargo.lock\fP file is up\-to\-date (such as a CI build) or want to avoid network
access.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-\-offline\fP
.RS 4
Prevents Cargo from accessing the network for any reason. Without this
flag, Cargo will stop with an error if it needs to access the network and
the network is not available. With this flag, Cargo will attempt to
proceed without the network if possible.
.sp
Beware that this may result in different dependency resolution than online
mode. Cargo will restrict itself to crates that are downloaded locally, even
if there might be a newer version as indicated in the local copy of the index.
See the \fBcargo\-fetch\fP(1) command to download dependencies before going
offline.
.sp
May also be specified with the \f[CR]net.offline\fP \c

.SS "Common Options"
.sp
\fB\-h\fP, \fB\-\-help\fP

Prints help information.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-Z\fP \fIFLAG\fP...
.RS 4
Unstable (nightly\-only) flags to Cargo. Run \f[CR]cargo \-Z help\fP for
details.
.RE
.SS "Miscellaneous Options"
.sp
\fB\-j\fP \fIN\fP, \fB\-\-jobs\fP \fIN\fP
.RS 4
Number of parallel jobs to run. May also be specified with the
\f[CR]build.jobs\fP \c
.URL "https://doc.rust\-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html" "config value" "."
Defaults to
the number of CPUs.
.RE
.SH "PROFILES"
.sp
Profiles may be used to configure compiler options such as optimization levels
and debug settings. See
.URL "https://doc.rust\-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the\-profile\-sections" "the reference" ""
for more details.
.sp
Profile selection depends on the target and crate being built. By default the
\f[CR]dev\fP or \f[CR]test\fP profiles are used. If the \f[CR]\-\-release\fP flag is given, then the
\f[CR]release\fP or \f[CR]bench\fP profiles are used.
