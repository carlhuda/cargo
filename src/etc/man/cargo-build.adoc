== NAME
cargo-build - Compile the current project


== SYNOPSIS
'cargo build' [OPTIONS]


== DESCRIPTION
This command compiles the current project.

If the *--package* argument is given, then 'SPEC' is a package id
specification which indicates which package should be built. If it is not given,
then the current package is built. For more information on 'SPEC' and its
format, see the "cargo help pkgid" command.

Compilation can be configured via the use of profiles which are configured in
the manifest. The default profile for this command is 'dev', but passing the
*--release* flag will use the 'release' profile instead.
